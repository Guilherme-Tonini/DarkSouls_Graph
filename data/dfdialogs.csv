10001,Aside,Prologue,"In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of grey crags, archtrees, and everlasting dragons. But then there was Fire. And with Fire, came Disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course... Light and Dark. Then, from the Dark, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame. Nito, the first of the dead, the Witch of Izalith, and her Daughters of Chaos, Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights, and the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten. With the Strength of Lords, they challenged the dragons. Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales. The witches weaved great firestorms. Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease. And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the dragons were no more. Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon, the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain. Even now, there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights. And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign."
10002,Aside,Northern Undead Asylum,"Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead. And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world. ...This is your fate."
10003,Aside,Leaving Undead Asylum,"Only, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day an Undead shall be chosen to leave the Undead Asylum, in pilgrimage, to the land of the Ancient Lords, Lordran."
20001,Chester,Talk-1st time,"Hm...Oh, let me guess... Snatched by a shadowy limb, and dragged off to the past?"
20002,Chester,"Choose ""No"" to his query","Oh, well, my mistake... But we are both travellers. We ought to help one another out."
20003,Chester,"Choose ""Yes"" to his query","Yes, of course. Exactly what happened to me. We are both strangers in this strange land. But, at least now there are two of us."
20004,Chester,Talk-2nd time,"Oh, still alive, are you? Think of anything that you might need?"
20005,Chester,Talk-3rd time,"Oh, for Juniper's sake. Put some spring into your step! Mwah hah hah!"
20006,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" before defeating Artorias","Did you happen across Knight Artorias? The legendary Abysswalker, from the old tales. ...Well, if you haven't, it's just as well... He's a colourless sort, if you ask me. Mwah hah hah!"
20007,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after accepting Elizabeth's query","So, what did that giant mushroom make you do? Not that I care. It's none of my business. But I do wonder about those sorceries of hers... Heh heh heh..."
20008,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","Hm? I've little to talk about, really. Oh, you know me. What do I know? Heh heh!"
20009,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time after defeating Artorias","Did you really slay Knight Artorias? I'd heard the Abyss found him first, but even still... That's absolutely treacherous. Yes, magnificently so! Mwah hah hah!"
20010,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time after defeating Artorias","Believe it or not, Oolacile has brought the Abyss upon itself. Fooled by that toothy serpent, they upturned the grave of primeval man, and incited his ornery wrath. What could they have been thinking? But to you and I, it's all ancient history. You have to ask yourself. Does it really matter? Heh heh heh..."
20011,Chester,Talk-After he invades the protagonist in the Oolacile Township,"Oh, you again... What ever's the matter? No, I can tell. You need me more than ever. Mwah hah hah!"
20012,Chester,Talk-After vanquishing his Dark Phantom in the Oolacile Township,"...Oh, you! You have quite some nerve. Or are you just thick? Fine, then. What is it that you need?"
20013,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after he invaded as Dark Phantom, but not vanquished","What? If you've something to say, then say it! Just don't say the wrong thing... Heh heh heh!"
20014,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after vanquishing his Dark Phantom","...Well, you've quite the nerve! I've had enough of you!"
20015,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Leave""",So long.
20016,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" after he invaded as Dark Phantom, but not vanquished",So long. ...We'll be seeing each other... Gee hee hee!
20017,Chester,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" after vanquishing his Dark Phantom",I'll be seeing you. If you survive your travels...
20018,Chester,Upon being attacked-1st time,Ooph!
20019,Chester,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Erg!
20020,Chester,Upon being attacked-3rd time,Oww!
20021,Chester,Upon being attacked-4th time,That bloody hurts!
20022,Chester,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"Oh! It's come to blows, has it? Fine, then. I've had enough of you, anyway!"
20023,Chester,"Upon being attacked & made hostile, after he invaded in Oolacile Township","What now? You think this my fault? How very, very petty of you! Very petty, indeed!"
20024,Chester,While attacking the protagonist,"There! Ah-hah, there!"
20025,Chester,After reducing the protagonist's health to below 11%,What? Now you're feeling the heat? You should have thought long and hard... Nyah hah hah hah hah!
20026,Chester,"Upon killing the protagonist in his hostile, non-Dark Phantom state",You damn fool. I am Marvellous Chester! What did you expect?
20027,Chester,Upon dying,"Hrrg... You win...please... Oh, please...have mercy..."
30001,Ciaran,Talk-1st time,"...Are you human? ...I forgive you. I am here to pay respects to a dear friend. Please, allow me a moment alone."
30002,Ciaran,Talk-1st time holding the Soul of Artorias,"...You, is that not... The soul of the man who fell on this spot? He was a dear friend. I wish to pay proper respect, with that soul. Would you be willing to part with it?"
30003,Ciaran,"Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","Yes, of course... ... ...I must not be presumptuous. Artorias would not have approved."
30004,Ciaran,"Talk-2nd time after choosing ""No"" to the 1st query",What is it? Something else? Have you changed your mind?
30005,Ciaran,"Choose ""No"" after choosing ""No"" to the 1st query",...Then you have no business with me...
30006,Ciaran,"Choose ""Yes"" to the 1st query",Thank you. You are very kind. Please take this. I no longer need it. May the Lord guide thee.
30007,Ciaran,"Talk-2nd time after choosing ""Yes"" to the 1st or 2nd query",May the Lord guide thee.
30008,Ciaran,Upon being attacked-1st time,Hrk!
30009,Ciaran,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Erg!
30010,Ciaran,Upon being attacked-3rd time,Ooh!
30011,Ciaran,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"Hmph, you humans... ...always taking what you please. Then, I shall do the same."
30012,Ciaran,Upon killing the protagonist,"Hmph, such conceit... How did you imagine that the Lord's Blade would not reach you?"
30013,Ciaran,Upon dying,"But, how... You humans... (No caption) My dear Artorias..."
40001,Crestfallen,Talk-1st time,"Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival. Let me guess. Fate of the Undead, right? Well, you're not the first. But there's no salvation here. You'd have done better to rot in the Undead Asylum... But, too late now. Well, since you're here... Let me help you out. There are actually two Bells of Awakening. One's up above, in the Undead Church. The other is far, far below, in the ruins at the base of Blighttown. Ring them both, and something happens... Brilliant, right? Not much to go on, but I have a feeling that won't stop you. So, off you go. It is why you came, isn't it? To this accursed land of the Undead? Hah hah hah hah..."
40002,Crestfallen,Talk-1st time as a Hollow,"Oh, your face! You're practically Hollow. It won't be long, if you keep dying like this. You'd best hurry and restore your humanity. But who knows, going Hollow could solve quite a bit! Hah hah hah hah..."
40003,Crestfallen,Talk-2nd time as a Hollow,"Hm, what? Restoring your humanity? Well, there are a few ways to go about it... Collect it bit by bit from corpses, or you can butter up a cleric, and get yourself summoned. And the quickest way, although I'd never do it, is to kill a healthy Undead, and pillage its humanity. Coveting thy neighbour is only human, after all! Hah hah hah hah..."
40004,Crestfallen,Talk-3rd time as a Hollow,What are you looking at? Don't try anything clever. You might regret it.
40005,Crestfallen,Talk-2nd time,"Hm? What, you want to hear more? Oh, that's all we need. Another inquisitive soul. Well, listen carefully, then... One of the bells is up above in the Undead Church, but the lift is broken. You'll have to climb the stairs up the ruins, and access the Undead Burg through the waterway. The other bell is back down below the Undead Burg, within the plague-infested Blighttown. But I'd die again before I step foot in that cesspool! Hah hah hah hah!"
40006,Crestfallen,Talk-3rd time,"Bloody hell, what is it now? You ask too many questions."
40007,Crestfallen,Talk-4th time,Hm? What now? I'm not up for chatting. Leave me alone.
40008,Crestfallen,"Talk-After attempting to talk with Anastacia, and resting at a Bonfire","Oh, have you seen that terribly morose lass? ...The Fire Keeper. She's stuck keeping that bonfire lit. Sad, really. She's mute and bound to this forsaken place. They probably cut her tongue out back in her village, so that she'd never say any god's name in vain. How do these martyrs keep chugging along? I'd peter out in an instant. Hah hah hah hah!"
40009,Crestfallen,Talk-Before entering the New Londo Ruins,"Have you been to the ruins of New Londo below? Just head down the stairs, and take the lift. It's certainly worth a visit. It was once an Undead city. You may find a clue or two. Unless the ghosts find you first... Keh heh heh heh!"
40010,Crestfallen,Talk-Before carring back to the Undead Asylum,"You again? There's nothing to speak about, really. Oh, actually...Something strange did happen. That crow flew off with somebody in its clutches. I think it was a man curled up in a ball. Stranger things have happened, right? No, maybe not..."
40011,Crestfallen,Talk-1st time without upgraded weapon after defeating the Taurus Demon,"Don't you ever think to forge your weapons? You'd better find a smithbox soon, Unless you enjoy swinging about with blunt instruments! Hah hah hah hah!"
40012,Crestfallen,Talk-2nd time without upgraded weapon after defeating the Taurus Demon,"Don't you ever think to forge your weapons? Perhaps you haven't heard of Andre. Visit him in the Old Church, in the forest behind the Undead Church. Perhaps you haven't heard of Andre. You really need to find him. Unless you enjoy swinging about with blunt instruments! Hah hah hah hah!"
40013,Crestfallen,Talk-While carrying an at-risk or broken weapon,"Don't you ever repair your weapons? You just need the right tools, or some powder. If you keep swinging those scraps around, you'll be mistaken for a Hollow! Hah hah hah hah!"
40014,Crestfallen,Talk-Before saving Griggs of Vinheim,"How did that silly sorcerer's apprentice end up? You know, the one always prattling on about Master Logan. He left for the Undead Burg, but never came back. Serves him right. If even Old Big Hat can't make it out there, what chance does he have? I hope he enjoys his new life as a Hollow."
40015,Crestfallen,Talk-After freeing Griggs from the lower Undead Burg,"How did that nutty sorcerer make it back? Unexpected, but I suppose stranger things have happened."
40016,Crestfallen,Talk-Before saving Laurentius from the Depths,"How did that raggedy old chum end up? You know, the one who idolized some godmother of pyromancy. He left for Blighttown, but never came back. Whereas most flee from sickness, he dives right in. Well, nothing will harm him once he goes Hollow."
40017,Crestfallen,Talk-After freeing Laurentius from the Depths,"How did that old man make it back? Unexpected, but I suppose stranger things have happened."
40018,Crestfallen,Talk-After Rhea arrived in Firelink Shrine,"Did you see her? That virtuous little maiden, complete with followers in tow. They're probably going straight to pillage graves. I've heard enough about ""M'Lady"" for a lifetime. What absolute rubbish, eh? Tsk!"
40019,Crestfallen,Talk-After Rhea left from Firelink Shrine,"Did you see that hoity-toity cleric? He went through the graveyard and down into the Catacombs. Clerics speak of some nonsense called Kindling, used to feed bonfires. They're so bloody determined. They practically queue to explore the Catacombs. Hah hah hah hah..."
40020,Crestfallen,Talk-After Petrus to return to Firelink Shrine,That cleric was spared? I never know what the Gods are thinking... Tsk!
40021,Crestfallen,Talk-1st time after saving Rhea from the Tomb of the Giants,"Did you hear about the maiden? The virtuous lass came back alone, and in absolute tatters... Did her followers die, or was she abandoned? Who knows. But I suppose we've heard the last from ""M'lady"". Hah hah hah hah!"
40022,Crestfallen,Talk-2nd time after saving Rhea from the Tomb of the Giants,That maiden? She's shuffled off somewhere. I believe to the Undead Church. These ruins were probably too awkward for her.
40023,Crestfallen,Talk-Before saving Logan from Sen's Fortress,"Oi, did you see him? Big Hat Logan, the legendary sorcerer, in the flesh! ...This place is simply mad... Legendary heroes popping up left and right... They're making me feel quite inadequate, to be honest! Hah hah hah hah..."
40024,Crestfallen,Talk-While Cursed,"Oi, hold on...Don't tell me, have you been cursed? Oh woe is the Undead who's cursed on top of it all! Harsh times; harsh times, indeed! Hah hah hah hah! Hah hah hah hah! No, no, I'm sorry. Here, let me share a nice tip. Long ago, I was told of a remedician who resides in New Londo. Does he really exist? Well, go and find out for yourself. But don't blame me if he's just an apparition! Hah hah hah hah!"
40025,Crestfallen,Talk-1st time after ringing 1st Bell of Awakening,"Why, what a surprise. I didn't expect you to make it. ...Oh, somebody rang the bell...Wait. Was it you? You never give up, do you? I don't know how you do it. Well, don't stop now. Only one more, but it's going to be suicide. Only one more now, if you have the heart for it. Hah hah hah hah..."
40026,Crestfallen,Talk-2nd time after ringing 1st Bell of Awakening,What's wrong? Get a bit of a scare out there? No problem. Have a seat and get comfortable. We'll both be Hollow before you know it. Hah hah hah hah...
40027,Crestfallen,Talk-3rd time after ringing 1st Bell of Awakening,"Well, what are you going to do? I've already decided. I don't really care; I'm simply crestfallen..."
40028,Crestfallen,Talk-1st time after ringing both Bells of Awakening,"Did you ring the second bell? That is incredible, I must say...But now we have a new problem. It's noisy, it snores, and its breath is lethal... This is no laughing matter, I tell you."
40029,Crestfallen,Talk-2nd time after ringing both Bells of Awakening,"Damn, that stench...And I was really beginning to like it here! Sigh... Maybe it's time I do something about it..."
40030,Crestfallen,Talk-3rd time after ringing both Bells of Awakening,Sigh... Maybe it's time I do something about it...
40031,Crestfallen,Upon being attacked-1st time,Ooph!
40032,Crestfallen,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Oww!
40033,Crestfallen,Upon being attacked-3rd time,What in the...!
40034,Crestfallen,Upon being attacked-4th time,Stop that! Oi!
40035,Crestfallen,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"Lousy rat! You have some nerve! I may be crestfallen, but I'm not defenceless, you rascal! You will soon regret this!"
40036,Crestfallen,Upon killing the protagonist,"Now, that's just embarrassing. How'd you let me do that to you?"
40037,Crestfallen,Upon dying,"Heheh, not too shabby... I think you've done me a favour..."
50001,Darkmoon,Talk-1st time,"Well, you are a rare visitor. Welcome to the lost city of Anor Londo, chosen Undead. If you seek Lord Gwyn's old keep, exit here and head straight yonder. If you are the chosen one, a revelation shall visit thee. ...What follows thereafter, depends upon you..."
50002,Darkmoon,Talk-2nd time,"Hmm. You have survived. Impressive. If you require rest, now is the time. That is, after all, what the bonfire is for."
50003,Darkmoon,Talk-1rd time after leaving & returning to Anor Londo,"Hmm. You have made it back. Very well. Go ahead, you may rest here. Even an Undead requires repose."
50004,Darkmoon,Talk-2rd time after leaving & returning to Anor Londo,"Hmm. You have made it back. You were gone so long. Go ahead, you may rest here. Even an Undead requires repose."
50005,Darkmoon,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","Hm, what is it? What am I? Well...I am the Keeper of the bonfire. If not for me, what beacon would there be in this lost city? A gatekeeper, and a guide; that is my calling."
50006,Darkmoon,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","The bonfires attended by the Keepers are special. They are linked to one another, and their flames never die. Yet never shall the Keepers of these flames meet."
50007,Darkmoon,Talk-1st time after receiving the Lordvessel,"Hmm. So, you have received a revelation? Very auspicious. I hope for the best. I pray that through you, Her wish will be granted."
50008,Darkmoon,Talk-2nd time after receiving the Lordvessel,"Have you heard of Seath the Scaleless? In legend, he turned against the ancient dragons. He became Lord Gwyn's confidant, was granted dukedom, and was allowed to pursue his research. At the Regal Archives, he immersed himself in research on scales of immortality, the one thing that he did not have. ...But his very research drove him mad... The Archives became a dungeon, a place for sinister experiments. Now, nobody dares even approach the duke's forbidden Archives. It looms over this land, high atop the mountain. But I should warn against even an approach..."
50009,Darkmoon,Talk-After obtaining all Lord Souls & Bequeathed Lord Soul Shards,"Will you be departing soon, honourable heir to Gwyn's Flame... We are humbled... For we exist only with your blessing."
50010,Darkmoon,"Talk-After joining the ""Blade of Darkmoon"" Covenant","Oh...You are one of us. That is a surprise. But a pleasant one. We are both Blades of the Darkmoon, now. I shall look forward to fighting alongside you."
50011,Darkmoon,Upon being attacked-1st time,What!
50012,Darkmoon,Upon being attacked-2nd time,How dare you!
50013,Darkmoon,Upon being attacked-3rd time,Hrk!
50014,Darkmoon,Upon being attacked-4th time,Rrgh!
50015,Darkmoon,Upon being attacked & made hostile,Very well. So be it. Expunging fools like you is part of my charge.
50016,Darkmoon,Meeting in hostile state after killing the illusion of Gwynevere,"So...It was you, was it? How dare you produce a blade upon a deity? How did you ever get this far? I shall end your suffering here and now. It is the least that I can do."
50017,Darkmoon,Upon killing the protagonist,Tis a pity...To think I saw potential in you...
50018,Darkmoon,Upon killing the protagonist after killing the illusion of Gwynevere,What you saw under light of the Darkmoon shall haunt you forever.
50019,Darkmoon,Upon dying,"...But, how... ...This man is a threat... ...This woman is a threat... ...Master Gwyndolin..."
60001,Domhnall,Talk-1st time,"Aye, siwmae. And good day to you. I'm Domhnall of Zena. I'm just, well, a peddler, of sorts. I adore trinkets and oddities, so I trade for them."
60002,Domhnall,Talk-2nd time,"Aye, siwmae. I adore trinkets and oddities, so I trade for them."
60003,Domhnall,Talk-After leaving & returning to the Depth,"Aye, siwmae. We meet again."
60004,Domhnall,Talk-1st time,"Aye, siwmae. I didn't expect to meet anybody here. I suppose great minds think alike, eh? Heh heh."
60005,Domhnall,Talk-After leaving & returning to the Firelink Shrine,"Aye, siwmae. Never thought I'd see you here. This feels karmaic. Pray tell, what do you have for me?"
60006,Domhnall,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" without purchasing something",Hmm... I'm afraid I don't see anything here.
60007,Domhnall,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time after purchasing something","Hmm... Well, I'm certain we will make a good trade eventually... So, I am willing to share some tips. If you seek Kindling in the Catacombs, use divine weapons. That will repel the reassembling skeletons."
60008,Domhnall,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time after purchasing something","Hmm... Well, I'm certain we will make a good trade eventually... So, I am willing to share some tips. The cursed Ghosts of New Londo are formidable foes. To face them, you will require special arms...Or a cursed body. The quickest way to be cursed?  Try the bug-eyed lizards in the sewer. Desperate measures, to be sure..."
60009,Domhnall,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time after purchasing something","Hmm... You are a fine trading partner. Rumour it may be, but I have heard of a surviving ancient dragon who resides in this land. A coterie of Undead serves the dragon, as they train to become dragons themselves. Sounds unlikely, but you never know, do you?"
60010,Domhnall,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" without purchasing something","Well, that is a shame, then. But no matter. No, not to worry. Come back again. I'm always available. Not every trade was meant to be. There'll be more in store for us, someday, sometime!"
60011,Domhnall,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" after purchasing something","Thank you. That was a fine trade. I have this funny feeling we'll meet again soon. And we'll make another fine trade, of course!"
60012,Domhnall,Upon being attacked-1st time,"Hold on, there!"
60013,Domhnall,Upon being attacked-2nd time,What's this about?
60014,Domhnall,Upon being attacked-3rd time,"Now, stop that!"
60015,Domhnall,Upon being attacked-4th time,Ouch!
60016,Domhnall,Upon being attacked-5th time,Oww!
60017,Domhnall,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"What problem do you have now? I'm a man of peace, idiot! Enough of you, I say, farewell."
60018,Domhnall,Upon dying,By the Lords...why... My precious collection...
70001,Dusk,Talk-1st time,"So, it is thou who rescueth me? Most gracious. I am deeply obliged. I am Dusk of Oolacile. I cometh from an age long before thine... I can not stay here for long. So, before I disappear, allow me to ask one thing. My home, Oolacile, is the home of ancient sorceries. My hope is to pass this profound knowledge to thee, with thine approval. Would this be of assistance to thee?"
70002,Dusk,"Choose ""No"" to the query","Yes, of course...I understand well. Pray forgive me. I have overstepped my boundaries. Farewell; another age, another land, beckons me to return. May the flames guide thee."
70003,Dusk,"Choose ""Yes"" to the query","My heartfelt thanks. I am pleased beyond words. Then, I shalt engrave my signature. If thou art in need, pray summon me from my signature. It seems that my time is done. May the great flames guide thee."
70004,Dusk,Talk-After summoning,I am Dusk of Oolacile. It is an honour to see thee again. I shall follow thine wishes.
70005,Dusk,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","For a very long time, I was trapped within the Crystal Golem. From my home I was taken, and banish'd to a plane of distortion. It was there, that thou came to my rescue. Long after I had relinquished all hope. So gleeful was I, my faith reneweth."
70006,Dusk,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","The sorceries of Oolacile differ from the magic of thine age. It is difficult to explain... Oolacile sorceries are, what doth one say? They are somewhat... of an approximation. Thine sorceries are more straight forward, negating all but thy self. Dost thou not find some fascination in these discrepancies?"
70007,Dusk,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time after resting at a Bonfire","My home of Oolacile was reduced to ashes, long ago, in my time. I have been alone ever since... But to be summon'd thus, and to be of service to thee... It is... most rewarding... Oh, forgive me, such a long-past time is none of thine concern..."
70008,Dusk,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time after defeating Manus, Father of the Abyss","...This may strike thine ear as somewhat peculiar, but... Long ago, in my homeland of Oolacile, I was beset by a creature from the Abyss. I would have perished then, were it not for the great knight Artorias. In truth, I saw little of what transpired, for mine senses were already fled! But even still, there was something about Artorias... A certain balance of the humours... ...That quite perfectly fits your semblance. Heavens, could it be that... ... Oh, dear me. That was Oolacile, many centuries ago. Please excuse my fanciful musings."
70009,Dusk,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time after defeating Manus, Father of the Abyss","Excuse me for such whimsical utterances. Only, it was so very odd... You, and Artorias. I owe my life to each of you. And both seem to share some resonance of sorts... Perhaps it is the nature of true greatness."
70010,Dusk,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time after defeating Manus, Father of the Abyss","I still think on that creature from the Abyss that preyed upon me. My faculties were far from lucid, but I quite clearly sensed certain emotions. A wrenching nostalgia, a lost joy, an object of obsession, and a sincere hope to reclaim it... Could these thoughts belong to the beast from the Abyss? But if that were true, then perhaps it is no beast after all? Oh, please forgive my ramblings. It's just that, I wish to know the truth. And no one, not even loving Elizabeth, will tell me."
70011,Dusk,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" without purchasing something","If thou art in need, pray summon me again. I wish to be of assistance... May the flames guide thee."
70012,Dusk,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" after purchasing something","If thou art in need, pray summon me again. I only wish to be of some genuine assistance... May the flames guide thee."
70013,Dusk,After leaving abruptly,"Wait, where... are..."
70014,Dusk,Talk-After leaving abruptly,Thou hast return'd. Bless thee.
70015,Dusk,Upon being attacked-1st time,What dost thou...
70016,Dusk,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Whatever for...
70017,Dusk,Upon being attacked-3rd time,Cease this barbarism...
70018,Dusk,Upon dying,"Ahh... Farewell, my rescuer..."
70019,Dusk,"Talk-1st time after defeating Manus, Father of the Abyss",...Mmn...ahh...
70020,Dusk,"Talk-2nd time after defeating Manus, Father of the Abyss",...Aah...mmn... ...Hmm...mm...
70021,Dusk,Upon being attacked,Aah...
70022,Dusk,Upon dying,Eek!
80001,Eingyi,Talk-1st time,...Oh dear...What have we here? Are you a new servant?
80002,Eingyi,"Choose ""No"" to the query",Then you shall not pass. Away with you!
80003,Eingyi,"Talk-After choosing ""No"" to the query","The nerve of you! Be gone, be gone at once!"
80004,Eingyi,"Choose ""Yes"" to the query","...Hmph. But you have no eggs? Bah, no matter. Go along and have audience with Our Fair Lady. I pray that you will mind your manners!"
80005,Eingyi,"Talk-After choosing ""Yes"" to the query, before talking to Daughter of Chaos","What is it? Go along, and meet Our Fair Lady."
80006,Eingyi,Talk-2nd time,"Are you prepared to dedicate yourself to Our Fair Lady? Then I will make available whatever you require. If you need something, ask me first."
80007,Eingyi,Talk-3rd time,You again...

200002,Lautrec,Talk-2nd time before using the Mystery Key to open his cell,"Please, I have duties to fulfil, and I will reward you handsomely. Well? I am certain you stand to benefit."
200003,Lautrec,After leaving abruptly,Why! You! Do not run away! Hear me out!

200008,Lautrec,"Talk-1st time without talking in the Undead Parish, or freeing him before",Hello...I don't think we've met. I am Knight Lautrec of Carim. We are both Undead. Perhaps we can help one another. Keh heh heh heh...
200009,Lautrec,"Talk-2nd time without talking in the Undead Parish, or freeing him before","Hmm, what business do you have? If you have none, then stay silent."
200010,Lautrec,"Talk-1st time after talking in the Undead Parish, without freeing him before",...You... How dare you come prancing about! I have nothing to say. Be gone from my sight.
200011,Lautrec,"Talk-2nd time after talking in the Undead Parish, without freeing him before",I have nothing to say. Be gone from my sight.

200013,Lautrec,Talk-2nd time after using the Mystery Key to open his cell,"Hm, you again? What is it? Our futures are murky. Let's not be too friendly, now."
200014,Lautrec,Talk-1st time,"Well, where have you been? I am glad to see you are safe."
200015,Lautrec,Talk-2nd time,"Have you heard of Trusty Patches? If ever a man has rubbed me up the wrong way, ugh! If he ever comes around again, I swear, I'll have his hide."
200016,Lautrec,Talk-As a Hollow,"By the Lords...Your face... Hmmm... Your humanity is really slipping. But there are methods. Most fools have more humanity than they know what to do with. Now, who do you imagine will make the best use of it, hmm?"
200017,Lautrec,Talk-After ringing 1st Bell of Awakening,"Oh, hello. I'm considering a change of location... I have a rather, pressing matter to attend to up above. That Keeper has served me well, but...enough with her... Keh heh heh heh..."
200018,Lautrec,Talk-After Petrus returned to Firelink Shrine,"Ahh, you certainly are keeping busy. Care to pay for a useful tip?"
200019,Lautrec,"Choose ""No"" to spending souls","Oh, really? Well, suit yourself. Only trying to help."
200020,Lautrec,"Choose ""Yes"" to spending souls","A wise choice, indeed. Maiden Thorolund and her followers recently arrived in this land, but she became stranded deep below the Catacombs. Her followers either fled, or were reduced to Hollows... Leaving Maiden Thorolund all alone. Not a bad tip, huh? A nubile cleric would be replete with humanity..."
200021,Lautrec,Talk-After buying the tip,"Hm? That tip I gave you? Ahh, I heard it from a fleeing old man. That poor bastard! All his robes and trinkets won't help him now! Kwah hah hah hah hah!"
200022,Lautrec,Upon being attacked-1st time,"Well, what have we here?"
200023,Lautrec,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Keh keh keh. Are you sure about this?

200026,Lautrec,Upon dying,You despicable... ...Curses...How could I...
200027,Lautrec,After using Black Eye Orb to invade him and approaching him-1st time,"Well, look at you. I thought you were wiser, but I thought wrong! Tis a terrible pity. Like a moth flittering towards a flame. You fellows? No? Don't you agree?"
200028,Lautrec,After using Black Eye Orb to invade him and approaching him-2nd time,"So, here we go again! How many times will these lambs rush to slaughter? Well, let's get it over with."
210001,Logan,Talk-1st time,"Mm, you seem quite lucid! A rare thing in these times. I am Logan. I'm a bit cooped up, as you can see. I have a bright idea. Suppose you set me free? I'm old and empty-handed, but I could repay you with knowledge, and sorcery. This place is melting my mind. The inactivity is repressive!"
210002,Logan,"Talk-2nd time, after opening his cage using the Cage Key","Oh, heavens, thank you. I'm saved. And, I'd love to resume my travels, but I must log a few things first, and I owe you a favour. I will return to Firelink Shrine. Speak with me there, so that I may impart my sorcery."
210003,Logan,Talk-3rd time,"Oh, hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead. I'll be along later. Phoo-hah-hah, I'll be just fine, young one."
210004,Logan,Talk-1st time with less than 15 Intelligence,"Hello there. I was expecting you. As promised, I will share my sorceries. ... I am afraid that you are unable to learn sorcery. The basic framework, you see. It cannot be taught. Oh, do not fret. Life isn't all about sorcery. You will find your own way. Don't frown with regret; peer forward with your head high."
210005,Logan,Talk-2nd time with less than 15 Intelligence,Hello there. Glad to see you alive.
210006,Logan,Talk-2nd time with 15 Intelligence or more after previously not enough,Hello there. Glad to see you alive. Hmm... It seems you've come quite a way... Excellent. You are certainly ready. I shall teach you sorceries.
210007,Logan,Talk-With 15 Intelligence or more-1st time,"There you are. I was expecting you. As promised, I will share my sorceries."
210008,Logan,Talk-With 15 Intelligence or more-2nd time,Hello there. You really are very diligent. I quite understand. Study is invigorating!
210009,Logan,Talk-With 15 Intelligence or more-3rd time,Hello there. Very well indeed. I'm pleased to share my sorceries.
210010,Logan,Talk-With 15 Intelligence or more-4th time,"Hello there. What have you been up to? I thought that perhaps you'd gone Hollow on me. So, have you come to further your study of sorcery?"
210011,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Leave""-1st time without purchasing something","No results, eh... Well, the way of sorceries is a long, hard road. Take it slowly."
210012,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Leave""-2nd time without purchasing something",Farewell.
210013,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" after purchasing something",I will stay here for the time being. Speak to me again to further your knowledge.
210014,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" after attaining the Lordvessel","Heading out, are you? I, too, will leave soon. Undead or no, I shan't stay here forever. ...You have great potential. Don't go and die over nothing."
210015,Logan,Talk-Before opening his cell with the Archive Tower Giant Cell Key,"Hello again! What a chance meeting this is! Alas, I'm imprisoned once again. I don't suppose you could stage me a getaway? The Archives, such a storehouse of knowledge. So close, but just out of reach! The thought offends me so, I could simply die! As a student of the arts, you understand me, yes?"
210016,Logan,Talk-1st time after opening his cell with the Archive Tower Giant Cell Key,"Oh, thank you very much. I'm saved. That makes twice. I must be sure to repay you. I will visit the Archives. If I discover any new spells, I shall share them with you. Prepare to be impressed, by the onward march of sorcery!"
210017,Logan,Talk-2nd time after opening his cell with the Archive Tower Giant Cell Key,Hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead. I'll head out soon. I wish to lay down my plans before I visit the Archives.
210018,Logan,Talk-1st time,"Hello there. I was expecting you. This place is truly magnificent, more than expected, even. As promised, I shall share the new sorceries with you. And, the secret of Seath's immortality."
210019,Logan,Talk-2nd time,"Hello there. You really are very diligent. Oh, I understand. We are in the midst of a revolution!"
210020,Logan,Talk-After resting at a Bonfire,"Oh, hello there. Where have you been? Time is a resource. Let's delve in promptly."
210021,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","Ah, the secret of Seath's immortality? If you have fought him, and were imprisoned, you must know that Seath is a true Undead, different from ourselves. His wounds close promptly, and no mortal blow affects him, granting true insulation from death. It is an effect of the Primordial Crystal, a sacred treasure pillaged by Seath when he turned upon the ancient dragons. So, only by destroying the Primordial Crystal can you so much as scratch his hide. And it so happens, the Primordial Crystal is in the inner garden of these very archives, the Crystal Forest."
210022,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","The tomes stored in these Archives are truly magnificent. A great pool of knowledge, the fruits of superior wisdom and an unquenchable desire for the truth. Some would say Seath had an unsound fixation ...But his work is a beautiful, invaluable resource. All progress demands sacrifice. And I certainly bear no antipathy for that wonderful scaleless beast."
210023,Logan,Talk-After defeating Seath the Scaleless,"Oh, there you are, it has been a while. Or, were you just here? This fascinating place defeats my sense of time..."
210024,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after defeating Seath",Mm...mm... Mm...mm...
210025,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after purchasing all of his spells & defeating Seath",...Who are you... ...Stay clear...stay clear of my work... ...Curses upon you! ...How dare you disturb me!
210026,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" without purchasing something",Farewell.
210027,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Leave""-1st time after purchasing something","Come again. The knowledge here is limitless. I will absorb it, then share it with you."
210028,Logan,"Menu-Choose ""Leave""-2nd time after purchasing something","Come again, any time you please. For I too, learn, whilst teaching a student."
210029,Logan,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"I fail to see your design, but if you think I'm too old to defend myself, perhaps some sorcery will change your mind!"
210030,Logan,Upon dying,Heavens...the folly of youth... ...I'm too old for this...

240002,Oscar,"Choose ""No"" to the query","...Yes, I see... ...Perhaps I was too hopeful... ...Hah hah... ...Please, leave me be... ...I have not long to live, and I may harm you after death. ...Now, go..."

270002,Patches,"After choosing ""No"" to being a cleric","No? Well, that's strange. Ohhh, I know what it is. You've come for the trinkets, haven't you? Well, whatever it is... This place is treacherous. Do watch your step. Heh heh heh..."

310009,Quelana,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","Long ago, I accepted another pupil, like yourself. Over two-hundred years ago, there was a man, almost as bungling as you... In your world he was called Salaman the Master Pyromancer. The little rascal really made something of himself."
310010,Quelana,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","Pyromancy is the art of invoking and manipulating fire. But remember one thing. Always fear the flame, lest you be devoured by it, and lose yourself. I would hate to see that happen again..."

Her power came from the soul that she found near the First Flame. ...She focused this power to light a flame of her own, but she failed to control it. The Flame of Chaos engulfed Mother and my sisters, and moulded them into deformed creatures. Only I escaped, and now I am here. But my mother and sisters have been in anguish since. I beseech you. Free Mother and my sisters from the Flame of Chaos. I cannot do it myself; I lack the strength, and the bravery... ...But you... I realize what I am asking. But please, free their poor souls... Mother's ambitions were misguided, no doubt, but surely a thousand years of atonement is enough!"

310020,Quelana,After leaving abruptly,Hm? What's the rush?
310021,Quelana,Talk-After leaving abruptly,What was that? You are a peculiar one.
310022,Quelana,Upon being attacked-1st time,What is it! Fool!
310023,Quelana,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Stop that!
310024,Quelana,Upon being attacked & made hostile,Hmm...The voice of reason fails? Then here is a lesson for you... That you can only learn once!
310025,Quelana,Upon dying,"Farewell, my mother, my sisters... What have you done..."
320001,Reah,Talk-1st time,"You are Undead, as well? Then we've no time to fraternize. I have my mission, and you no doubt have yours. We must not let this curse overcome us."
320002,Reah,Talk-2nd time,Did I not explain the urgency of our tasks? Who are you so uncouth as to lack such judgement? By the looks of you...I should think not.
320003,Reah,Talk-1st time,"You're no Hollow, are you? Thank goodness. Please be careful. There are two fierce Hollows not far from here. They were once brave knights...my former escorts. Who would let such strong spirits be Hollowed so? Heavens...Is there nothing...Nothing at all to be done?"
320004,Reah,Talk-After defeating both Hollowed Vince & Nico,"You banished those two Hollows, did you? It pains me to think of the trouble my failings have caused. I am certain that both Vince and Nico are grateful to you. Thank you so very much. Here, these belonged to them.  You deserve them more than I."

320009,Reah,Upon killing the protagonist,O piteous soul... But...perhaps...this was a fate unyielding...
320010,Reah,Upon dying,Hrgkt! Eeg... Father...
320011,Reah,Talk-1st time,"Hello...I will never forget what you did. I am deeply indebted, for it was not within my power to save Vince or Nico. I cannot thank you enough. In case you have not heard, I am Reah of Thorolund. I only wish there were some way I could help you, but I am inexperienced, and I only know the art of Miracles. If that could be of any help, speak to me again."
320012,Reah,Talk-2nd time,"Would a Miracle be of any help to you? I would be most pleased if that were so. May we discuss Miracles, then?"
320013,Reah,Talk-3rd time,I am most pleased to find you in good health. I am ready. Let us speak of Miracles.
320014,Reah,Talk-4th time,"I was wondering when you might return. It is a great relief to see you. Now, let us speak of Miracles."
320015,Reah,Talk-5th time,"Oh! Please, forgive me. I was absorbed in prayer. The Miracles, I presume? I will be ready immediately."
320016,Reah,"Menu-Choose ""Talk""-1st time","Vince and Nico were fooled by a lout named Patches,  and turned into Hollows. My prayers did them no good. It is my ignorance, my frailty that has sealed their fates. Perhaps Petrus realized my weakness all along, and thus made the decision to abandon me. I can hardly blame him now."
320017,Reah,"Menu-Choose ""Talk""-2nd time","I do not warm easily to unfamiliar faces. The bonfire below is so very frequented, it makes it difficult... I have lost all those who were close to me."
320018,Reah,"Menu-Choose ""Leave""","Then, be safe. Farewell. Vereor Nox"
320019,Reah,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"Why on earth would you... Perhaps this is my punishment? Clearly, I am no threat to you. But please, I ask just one thing. If I do go Hollow, then finish me off. I beg of you."
320020,Reah,Upon dying,"Dear Vince, dear Nico... Forgive me..."
330001,Rickert,Talk-1st time,"Hrm? Well, this is unusual. You haven't lost your head. And more importantly, you're free. How on earth... ...Well, I shouldn't pry. I am Rickert of Vinheim. I was once an established smith, but look at me now. Can you believe it?"
330002,Rickert,Talk-2nd time,"Hm? What is it? Have you...Oh, no, don't worry. I've no intention of escape. It's safe here. I can't bear the thought of going Hollow out there. Although, I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself. How about this?  I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather minimal tools. I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!"
330003,Rickert,Talk-3rd time,"Oh, hello. What weapons have you brought? Go on; show me."
330004,Rickert,Talk-4th time,"Oh, hello. I was beginning to wonder when you'd come. Have you materials? Go on, show me."
330005,Rickert,Talk-5th time,"Hm? What is it? Normally I wouldn't bother, but... I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself. How about this?  I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather minimal tools. I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!"
330006,Rickert,"Menu-Choose ""Talk""","Hm? What is it? There's nothing to talk about. We're both cursed; Undead. But what's there, really, to moan about?"
330007,Rickert,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time after freeing Griggs of Vinheim","Old Big Hat? Of course I've heard of him. Who hasn't in Vinheim? He was a royal member of Dragon School, until he turned Undead. I hear he was quite the character... Only, that was a hundred years ago. What interest have you in the old eccentric now?"
330008,Rickert,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time after freeing Griggs of Vinheim","Sorcery? Don't ask me how it actually works. We only fiddle and forge, until it works itself in. That's how we do it in Vinheim, at least. We prefer to leave the theorizing to those uppity scholars."
330009,Rickert,Talk-After obtaining the Large Magic Ember,"Hey, hang on... That's a sorcery ember...isn't it? Yes, it certainly is... The first I've seen since my banishment from Vinheim. What do you say, friend? Mind giving that to me? This is no-man's land. I'm the only one who could handle it anyway."
330010,Rickert,"Choose ""No"" to giving the Large Magic Ember","...Yes, I see. All right, fine. But I don't think you're really seeing things clearly."
330011,Rickert,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Large Magic Ember","Yes, as you should! I won't disappoint you. I'm taskless no longer!"
330012,Rickert,Talk-After obtaining the Enchanted Ember,"Hey, hang on... Is that...a sorcery ember? I've never seen one like that, not even back in Vinheim. What a brilliant flame! Please, friend, let me have that. I am begging you. I am a craftsman of Vinheim. I'd go Hollow before I pass up a flame like that!"
330013,Rickert,"Choose ""No"" to giving the Enchanted Ember","...Fine. ...Fine, I won't bother you. It was wonderful if only to gaze upon. It takes me back to old times."
330014,Rickert,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Enchanted Ember","Oh, really! You are wonderful! I will forge a Rickert masterpiece, just for you! A weapon to make a legend out of you..."
330015,Rickert,Talk-While holding an ember he cannot handle,"Hey, hang on... Is that an ember? Oh, no, I'm sorry. We of Vinheim don't deal in shoddy embers like that. Perhaps you should try an old smith out in the country."
330016,Rickert,After leaving abruptly,Hm? What's happened?
330017,Rickert,Talk-After leaving abruptly,"What was that about? Ahh, it doesn't matter."
330018,Rickert,"Choose ""Leave"" without forging or reinforcement",Come back soon. Smithing helps soothe my nerves. Don't let me wither away out of idleness!
330019,Rickert,"Choose ""Leave"" after forging or reinforcement","Good-bye, then. Keep your head on, out there. You really help break the monotony."
330020,Rickert,Upon being attacked,What's got into you!
330021,Rickert,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"Damn, you've gone Hollow, have you? Forget about it! I have nothing more to say. Be gone! Oh, go away! There's nothing here for you. Nothing at all."
330022,Rickert,Upon dying,No...impossible... Why didn't I see? ...You've gone Hollow...
340001,Shiva,Talk-1st time after joining the Forest Hunter Covenant,"I've heard all about you. I'm Shiva of the East, captain of the brigade. Let's teach you the clan basics now, as there is no time to chat in the midst of fighting. Except there's little in the form of rules, you hear? Fight and hunt as you like. Whoever's fastest gets the prey. That's the way we do it. Only...Don't forget what Alvina said. Traitors aren't given a second chance, for any reason. That's about it, then. Don't worry, it's a good old time, isn't it? Great to have you with us. Good hunting to you."
340002,Shiva,Talk-2nd time,"Don't worry, now. You'll be called in soon enough. Hunters with patience score the best kills."
340003,Shiva,Talk-After speaking to his Shinobi bodyguard,"Ah, did you notice that one? Sharp eyes! He's one of the clan. From the East, like myself. Always slinking in the shadows, but he's a tough one. You'll see what I mean. Hah hah hah hah!"
340004,Shiva,Talk-1st time,"Hello again. Strange to meet away from the clan and the forest. But while you're here, how about some equipment? I love collecting these things, but I can only keep so many. And, you know, you are a friend. I'll sell them cheap."
340005,Shiva,Talk-2nd time,"We meet again. I have the equipment, if you have the need."
340006,Shiva,Talk-3rd time,"Well, there you are again. I've culled my best picks from my last summoning. Have a look, will you?"

340012,Shiva,Upon being attacked-3rd time,"Why, you dirty...!"
340013,Shiva,Upon being attacked-4th time,Have you lost it?
340014,Shiva,"Upon being attacked & made hostile, right after joining the Forest Hunter","Turning on us from the very start? Have a look at my sword, for it's the last thing you'll see!"
340015,Shiva,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"You have some guts, to turn on us! Have a look at my sword, for it's the last thing you'll see!"
340016,Shiva,Upon killing the protagonist,You sick Hollow... Don't you ever come round again.
340017,Shiva,After reducing his health to 30% or lower,Hiyaah! Haaah! Hiiyah!
340018,Shiva,Upon dying,You poor fool... You won't be able to run far enough...

350003,Sieglinde,"Choose ""No"" to the query","Yes, I see...But if you should happen to bump into him, tell him that Sieglinde is on her way, and that he ought to just stay put. And again, thank you kindly."
350004,Sieglinde,"Choose ""Yes"" to the query","Thank goodness! I knew he was here somewhere. Well then, now I must find him. Thanks again, truly. Now if he'll just stay put, and keep out of trouble."

350007,Sieglinde,"Choose ""Yes"" to the query",Really! Then I must be off. I'm sorry he's caused you trouble... He has a knack for that. If he'd just stay put...

350009,Sieglinde,Talk-2nd time after helping Siegmeyer defeat & survive the 4 Chaos Eaters,"My father? He went on his final adventure. Don't worry, that's just the way he is. Undead or no. Sort of reassuring, really. If he goes Hollow, I'll just have to kill him again."
350010,Sieglinde,Talk-1st time,"My father...all Hollow now... has been subdued. He will cause no more trouble. It's finally over...I will return to Catarina. You assisted us both greatly. I can hardly return the favour, but please accept this. It's of no use to me now."

350015,Sieglinde,Upon killing the protagonist,Rest assured. I will kill you as many times as it takes.
350016,Sieglinde,Upon dying,"Oh, how can this be...! ...dear Father..."
360001,Siegmeyer,Talk-1st time,Mmm... Hrmmmmm...
360002,Siegmeyer,Talk-2nd time,"Mmm...mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! Forgive me. I was absorbed in thought. I am Siegmeyer of Catarina. Quite honestly, I have run flat up against a wall. Or, a gate, I should say. The thing just won't budge. No matter how long I wait. And, oh, have I waited! So, here I sit, in quite a pickle. Weighing my options, so to speak! Hah hah hah hah!"
360003,Siegmeyer,Talk-3rd time,Still closed... Still closed... Mmm...
360004,Siegmeyer,Talk-1st time,"Mmm...mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! Ahh, where did you come from? Splendid news, I tell you. Hah hah hah hah!"
360005,Siegmeyer,Talk-2nd time,"Mn, mmm...Ah, so you see my plight? Yes, indeed, I have run up against a wall. ...Or, a ball, to be precise. ...I'm afraid I'm a bit too plump to be outrunning those things. So, here I sit, in quite a pickle. But who knows? Perhaps we'll have another development? Hah hah hah hah!"
360006,Siegmeyer,Talk-3rd time,"Perhaps I could try some rolling... ...Bah, no chance. My head would spin. Mmm..."
360007,Siegmeyer,Talk-1st time,Mmm... Hrmmmmm... Whatever can be done?
360008,Siegmeyer,Talk-2nd time,"Ah, you again! Let me guess. Were you repelled by the Silver Knights? Aww, don't be ashamed. 'Tis the fate of vanguards like you and I. I'll think of something. We can overcome this, together!"
360009,Siegmeyer,Talk-3rd time,"This is quite a fix... We'll need another three, no, maybe five bodies... Hmm...quite a fix indeed..."
360010,Siegmeyer,Talk-After defeating the Silver Knights in the adjacent room,"Mmm...mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! What's on your mind, friend? Wait!...You defeated those monsters?! Fantastic...I am saved. This knight of Catarina hereby commends you! Take this, as a token of my gratitude. But be warned, gallantry entails great risks. Next time, give me a chance to come up with a plan."
360011,Siegmeyer,Talk-1st time,"Well! Fancy meeting you here. You did much for me up above. I am grateful. You know, I was thinking... The gates at the old fortress... Was that your doing?"
360012,Siegmeyer,"Choose ""No"" to the query","Is that so? Hmm, no matter. Stranger things have happened. Sometimes one only has to give it some time."
360013,Siegmeyer,"Choose ""Yes"" to the query","Yes! I knew it! It seemed like an unlikely coincidence. Well, am I fortunate! This knight of Catarina thanks you sincerely. Please take this, as a token of my gratitude."
360014,Siegmeyer,Talk-2nd time,There you are. I'll be heading down below shortly. There's nothing worthwhile up above. No worries! Adventuring is my life; I'm prepared for the worst. Hah hah hah hah!
360015,Siegmeyer,Talk-1st time,Sng...sng... Zzzzzz...
360016,Siegmeyer,Talk-2nd time,"Mm! Oh-hoh! Excuse me. I was so absorbed in thought, I just drifted away. You see, I'm actually in a bit of a fix. I've made it this far, but I'm short on antitode moss for the trip back. By my knighthood, I am ashamed to ask... But can you spare a few scraps of moss?"
360017,Siegmeyer,"Choose ""No"" to the query or ""Yes"" without carrying 3 Purple Moss Clumps","Yes, I see... No need to worry! I'll be fine. I can make it without that silly moss. Think about it. Have I ever let a little hardship slow me down? Hah hah hah hah!"
360018,Siegmeyer,"Talk-After choosing ""No"", or ""Yes"" without carrying 3 Purple Moss Clumps","Mmm... Mm! Oh-hoh! What's on your mind, friend? You've brought moss, perchance?"
360019,Siegmeyer,"Choose ""Yes"" to the query","Fantastic! Thank you, a saint you are. This knight of Catarina expresses his deepest gratitude. I shall not forget this. Please, take this; a symbol of my appreciation. Well, our fates do seem entwined, don't they? Perhaps this, too, is the will of Lord Gwyn! Hah hah hah hah!"
360020,Siegmeyer,Talk-After giving him 3 Purple Moss Clumps,The Poison Swamp... It's like quicksand in there... Mmm...
360021,Siegmeyer,Talk-1st time,Sng...sng... Zzzzzz...
360022,Siegmeyer,Talk-2nd time,"Mm! Oh-hoh! Excuse me. I was so absorbed in thought, I just drifted away. It must be the warmth. Well, what's on your mind? No, don't tell me. Those monsters making life difficult for you? You need not be ashamed. We are in the same boat. ...You know, I really have run up quite a debt to you. ...Perhaps the time has come... ..."
360023,Siegmeyer,Talk-3rd time,"... Friend, I have an idea. A good one, really. ...I will rush those dire fiends, and you can slip away in the confusion. Please, friend, I owe you much more than this. By the honour of the knights of Catarina, allow me to assist you. And now, I go! Don't be slow!"
360024,Siegmeyer,Talk-After defeating the 4 Chaos Eaters without him,"... Oh, there you are. Wait!...Did you defeat those dire creatures? Outstanding...You never fail to impress. Well, wonderful. This knight of Catarina thanks you. Take this, as a token of my gratitude. I feel like I'm always thanking you... I curse my own inability."
360025,Siegmeyer,After he drops off the ledge and begins to fight the 4 Chaos Eaters,"Hrgrraaaaggh! Hiyaaaaaah! C'mon! Over here, you fiends! Perish, foul creatures! I am Siegmeyer of Catarina, and you shall feel my wrath!"
360026,Siegmeyer,"Talk-After defeating the 4 Chaos Eaters together, if he has less than 50% HP","Hng...hng... Why, you! Didn't you get away? Well, you've saved me, once again... Dear me, what can I say? I have failed you... Hrgph...Aggkt... My dear little Lin..."
360027,Siegmeyer,"Talk-After defeating the 4 Chaos Eaters together, if he has 50% HP or more","Hng...hng... But, you! Didn't you get away? Well, you've saved me, once again... Thank goodness...I'm exhausted... I think I'll have a rest. Don't you worry, the ground below me is my pillow. I'll recover shortly..."
360028,Siegmeyer,Upon being attacked-1st time,Yeeg!
360029,Siegmeyer,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Whoa!
360030,Siegmeyer,Upon being attacked-3rd time,Wha!
360031,Siegmeyer,Upon being attacked-4th time,"Why, are you...!"
360032,Siegmeyer,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"That's your game, is it? Well, I'm certainly not backing down! By the honour of my knighthood!"
360033,Siegmeyer,Upon dying,"Heavens, me... My dear little Lin..."
370001,Solaire,Talk-1st time,"Ah, hello! You don't look Hollow, far from it! I am Solaire of Astora, an adherent of the Lord of Sunlight. Now that I am Undead, I have come to this great land the birthplace of Lord Gwyn, to seek my very own sun! ...Do you find that strange? Well, you should! No need to hide your reaction. I get that look all the time! Hah hah hah!"
370002,Solaire,Talk-2nd time,"Oh, ah-hah! So, I didn't scare you? I have a proposition, if you have a moment."
370003,Solaire,"Choose ""No"" to either the 1st or 2nd query","Well, yes, quite understandable. Not to worry. Let there be no obligation."
370004,Solaire,"Talk-After choosing ""No"" to either the 1st or 2nd query","Oh, hello. You're still keen on speaking to me? Then, perhaps you have reconsidered my offer?"
370005,Solaire,"Choose ""Yes"" to the 1st or 3rd query","The way I see it, our fates appear to be intertwined. In a land brimming with Hollows could that really be mere chance? So, what do you say? Why not help one another on this lonely journey?"
370006,Solaire,"Choose ""No"" after choosing ""Yes"" to the 1st query","Not to worry. I do not wish to impose. I was in the wrong. We'll laugh it off, shall we? Hah hah hah!"
370007,Solaire,"Choose ""Yes"" to the 2nd query","This pleases me greatly! Well then, take this. We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land. The flow of time itself is convoluted; with heroes centuries old phasing in and out. The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and obscure. There's no telling how much longer your world and mine will remain in contact. But, use this, to summon one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the worlds, and engage in jolly co-operation! Of course, we are not the only ones engaged in this. But I am a warrior of the sun! Spot my summon signature easily by its brilliant aura. If you miss it, you must be blind! Hah hah hah!"
370008,Solaire,"Talk-After choosing ""Yes"" to both 1st or 2nd query","Oh, hello there. I will stay behind, to gaze at the sun. The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father! If only I could be so grossly incandescent!"
370009,Solaire,Talk-1st time,"Oh, there you are. You've been quiet these days. Smooth summoning out there? Anytime you see my brilliantly shining signature, do not hesitate to call upon me. You've left me with quite an impression. I would relish a chance to assist you."
370010,Solaire,Talk-2nd time,"You really are fond of chatting with me, aren't you? If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for me! Oh, no, dear me. Pretend you didn't hear that! Hah hah hah!"
370011,Solaire,Talk-1st time,"Hmm! Ah, oh...hello there. Forgive me, I was just pondering... about my poor fortune. I did not find my own sun, not in Anor Londo, nor in Twilight Blighttown. Where else might my sun be? Lost Izalith, or the Tomb of the Gravelord...? But I cannot give up. I became Undead to pursue this! But when I peer at the Sun up above, it occurs to me... What if I am seen as a laughing stock, as a blind fool without reason? Well, I suppose they wouldn't be far off! Hah hah hah!"
370012,Solaire,"Talk-1st time with 25 faith, or 5 less with each victory as  White Phantom","Oh, hello there. I'm glad to see you alive. ...You have done well, indeed you have. You've a strong arm, strong faith, and most importantly, a strong heart. I am in awe, really. Yes, yes... What do you think? Why not join me, as a warrior of the Sun? Righteous knights, guardians of all that is good, in the name of the Lord of Sunlight! ...Only if it would please you, of course. Well?"
370013,Solaire,"Choose ""No"" to either the 1st or 2nd query","Yes, well, each has one's beliefs. But if you change your mind, the offer is open."
370014,Solaire,"Talk-After choosing ""No"" to either the 1st or 2nd query","Oh, hello there. What is it? Have you changed your mind about my offer?"
370015,Solaire,"Choose ""Yes"" to the 1st query","Oh! Magnificent! I knew you would fancy it! Then, join the Covenant! Here, stay still for a moment..."
370016,Solaire,"Choose ""Yes"" to the 2nd query","And there we are. Now, just say a prayer at the Altar of Sunlight, right there. Then you shall know the brilliance of our Sun."
370017,Solaire,Talk-1st time after joining the Warriors of Sunlight Coverant,"Oh, hello there. Exhilarating, is it not? The power of the Sun! I am blessed to have found such a brave companion! Hah hah hah!"
370018,Solaire,Talk-2nd time after joining the Warriors of Sunlight Coverant,"Oh, hello there. Still here? I could not hope for a braver companion than you! Gah hah hah hah hah!"
370019,Solaire,Talk,"Was it all a lie? Have I done this all, for nothing? Oh, my dear sun...What now, what should I do...? ...My sun, my dear, dear sun..."
370020,Solaire,Talk-After killing the Red-Eye Sunlight Maggot before entering Lost Izalith,"...Why?...Why?... After all this searching, I still cannot find it..."
370021,Solaire,Upon being attacked-1st time,Hrg!
370022,Solaire,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Ooh!
370023,Solaire,Upon being attacked-3rd time,Whoa!
370024,Solaire,Upon being attacked-4th time,What the...!
370025,Solaire,Upon being attacked-5th time,What's wrong with you?!
370026,Solaire,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"If a stubborn beast you be, I have no choice! A Warrior of the Sun will not just sit and take it! Hrgraaah!"
370027,Solaire,Upon dying,"Why, you... How could this...? My...my sun..."
370028,Solaire,After approaching him once he has been infected by the Sunlight Maggot,"...Hrg, rg...Arrrgh... ...Finally, I have found it, I have!... ...My very own sun...I...am the sun!... ...I've done it...I have... ...Yes, I did it...I did!... ...Ohh, ohhh... ...Hrgrraaaooogh!..."
370029,Solaire,Upon dying after infected by the Red-Eye Sunlight Maggot,"...Ahh, it's over... ...My Sun...it's setting... ...It's dark, so dark..."
380001,Undeadman,Talk-1st time,"Well, now... You seem to have your wits about you, hmm? Then you are a welcome customer! I trade for souls. Everything's for sale! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
380002,Undeadman,Talk-2nd time,"Oh, you again? I hope you've brought plenty of souls? Nee hee hee hee hee!"
380003,Undeadman,Talk-After resting at a Bonfire,"Oh, there you are. Still keeping your marbles all together? Then, go ahead, don't be a nitwit. Never hurts to splurge when your days are numbered! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
380004,Undeadman,Talk-After leaving & returning to Undead Burg,"Oh, there you are. Where have you been hiding? I guessed you'd hopped the twig for certain. Bah, shows what I know! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
380005,Undeadman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","Things are getting treacherous in these parts. A horrible goat demon has moved in below. And up above, there's that humungous drake, and a bull demon, too. If you stick around this place, it might end up being your grave! Nee hee hee hee hee!"
380006,Undeadman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","Eh? I'm not here to chit-chat. We talk business, or we talk nothing at all."
380007,Undeadman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","Ah, this one? Ain't she lovely? Her name is Yulia. She's plumb in love with me. You'd never leave my side, now would you, Yulia?"
380008,Undeadman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","Ah, you can forget it. I'm all that she needs. Careful, she'll bite your little fingers off! Be kind, Yulia, be kind! Nee hee hee hee hee!"

380010,Undeadman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 6th time","It's actually quite nice here, you know? The Hollows don't care for a skinny old twig like me. I've got Yulia...And nobody pelts me with stones anymore. You're Undead, you know how it is. I was treated worse back at home."
380011,Undeadman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 7th time","Eh? My wares? Of course they're stolen; what did you think? And when you lose your head, I'll sell it all again! Nee hee hee hee hee!"

380018,Undeadman,Talk-After leaving abruptly,"What was that about? Oh, nevermind."
380019,Undeadman,Upon being attacked-1st time,Eeg!
380020,Undeadman,Upon being attacked-2nd time,Yeowch!
380021,Undeadman,Upon being attacked-3rd time,"Oi, what's this about?"
380022,Undeadman,Upon being attacked-4th time,"It's me! Stop it, I tell you!"
380023,Undeadman,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"You've gone mad, have you!? I'll teach you! You lousy rat! Yulia! Yulia!"

390001,Undeadwoman,Talk-1st time,"Hmm, you still have your senses about you? Then why won't you buy some of my moss? I need your souls! Vee hee hee!"

390005,Undeadwoman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","You've come to this land at a bad time. There are nothing but Hollows in these parts. Save for me, of course. You're Undead, too, aren't you? You be careful, then. Vee hee hee!"
390006,Undeadwoman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","Ah, go down along the side to reach the depths of the Undead Burg. Only unkempt crooks and liars to be found there. Hardly a place for a lady like myself! But who knows, maybe you'd fit right in? Vee hee hee hee hee!"
390007,Undeadwoman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","This is a wonderful place, don't you think? We have water, moss, moisture, these nice iron bars... I like it here, I really do. Nothing good ever happened to me in life. But now that I'm Undead, I've never been happier!"
390008,Undeadwoman,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","I forage moss. In the lower areas of this town, you'll find all kinds of poison and pestilence. You can't travel a stone's toss without some trusty moss. Make sure you take plenty with you! Vee hee hee!"

Yes, I suppose you think you're special! Well, you're not! You're just another customer! Burn! Burn in hell! You cross-eyed Hollow! There's no hope for anyone like you! The Gods will not have it! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die a thousand times again! Curses upon you! Upon you, and yours, for generations eternal! All of you! Eternal pain and suffering! Lots and lots!"

400006,Vamos,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","Well, you are a persistent one, are you not? But I'm afraid I'm a mere blacksmith, it's just me and my trade. I would be of no help to a righteous warrior such as yourself."
400007,Vamos,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 5th time, after defeating the Gaping Dragon","I've told you, I have nothing to discuss... If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more. I'd be of more help with that ember from New Londo, of course... It's a shame the whole place was flooded..."
400008,Vamos,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 6th time after defeating Chaos Witch Quelaag","I've told you, I have nothing to discuss... If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more. Speaking honestly, I must say that I'm at my very limit. There's no more work to be done. Ahh, unless I had the flame of that legendary witch... But that would require a visit to Lost Izalith. Impossible..."
400009,Vamos,Talk-After finding the Large Flame Ember,"...Hmph? Why, is that... ...An ember from New Londo... ...And a fine ember it be... What do you say? Why not leave it with me? I'll give you a flame to feast your eyes upon."

400011,Vamos,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Large Flame Ember","Yes, yes, very well! We'll get these old bones to work! Keh heh heh!"
400012,Vamos,Talk-After finding the Chaos Flame Ember,"...Hmph? Why, that's... ...an ember unlike any that I have seen... ...a very curious pattern... ...Could it be the flame of the legendary witch? ...I know! Suppose you left that ember with me? Old Vamos would never let you down, no, not ever!"
400013,Vamos,"Choose ""No"" to giving the Chaos Flame Ember","Hmm, hmm...Fine, then... I doubt you'd even...bah, forget it... These bones won't fail me anytime soon. I'll come across another, eventually..."
400014,Vamos,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Chaos Flame Ember","Keh heh heh heh heh! Yes, splendid, splendid indeed! ...My, oh, my! You precious little thing..."
400015,Vamos,Talk-After finding an ember Vamos cannot use,"...Hmph? Why, you have... ...an ember, do you? Ahh, forget about it. I don't deal with that kind. What has gone wrong with embers these days?"

400017,Vamos,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" after purchasing something","If that'll be all, then be gone with you! ...You'll spoil my focus."

400020,Vamos,Upon being attacked-1st time,Bah!
400021,Vamos,Upon being attacked-2nd time,You rotten scoundrel!
400022,Vamos,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"Trying to cause trouble, are you? I am Vamos the blacksmith, and I'm no bag of bones!"
400023,Vamos,Upon dying,Curses...
410001,Vince,Talk-1st time,Hm? What have we here? You look awfully raggedy... Times are grim; the least you can do is look sharp. Don't you dare meet M'lady like that. You might scare her off for good!
410002,Vince,Talk-2nd time,"Oh, you again. What business have you? I don't suppose we can help, though. We accompany M'lady on her righteous mission. It is quite a chore, but I'm stuck with her, and Nico, too. I can't very well abandon them now."
410003,Vince,"Talk-3rd time, after resting at a Bonfire","Oh, you yet again. You're a persistent one, aren't you? Hah hah hah. Honestly, I don't have a problem with your kind. But there's not very much that I can do. I am Vince of Thorolund. Let's say a word, for our safety. A prayer to our marvellous Lord. Vereor Nox"
410004,Vince,Talk-After talking with Petrus and exhausting his dialogue,"Oh, it's you? We are to leave momentarily. The Catacombs aren't exactly my idea of a good time, but... What can one do? I do hope we meet again. Vereor Nox"

420001,Alvina,Talk-1st time,"Is it not so that thou art new. Thou fared well to find me. But cometh thee not for the grave of Sir Artorias? My advice true, forget this! The legend of Artorias art none but a fabrication. ...Traversing the dark? 'Tis but a fairy tale. Have thine own respect, go not yonder knocking for nothing, I say!"
420002,Alvina,"Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","Hmm, I see. A result most heathenish and gross. Then there is nothing more to say about this tedious reckoning. Be gone from here. Pernicious caitiff."
420003,Alvina,"Choose ""Yes"" to the 1st query","Well indeed, thou art a strange one! Nevertheless, I feel some liking for thee. I'm Alvina of the Darkroot Wood. I command a clan of hunters who track down defilers of the forest graves. What dost thou say? Wilt thou not join us? Oh yes, I believe we would suit thee well."
420004,Alvina,"Choose ""No"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","Oh, I see. 'Tis a pity indeed. But this is thine stubborn choice alone. I cannot enforce it upon thee. If thine mind should be alter'd, forsooth speak to me once more."
420005,Alvina,"Talk- After choosing ""No"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","Oh, thou art here. Tell me thou hast thought on't once more and will join us?"
420006,Alvina,"Choose ""Yes"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","I am very glad! And now thou art one of us! Let us establish a Covenant. And here, taketh this ring. If thou weareth that ring, it allows for thine summoning. If mine senses reveal intruders, then I will summon thee. Fend them off sir, I beseech only this. I shall summon others, who will by their honour work tirelessly with thee. Thou shalt receive great reward, and whatsoever ye shall pillage will be thine own. A true agreement, not so? But thou must heed the golden rule... The clan is thine own family. To thine kinsmen forever stay true. Dare'st not in any attempt to double-cross. Have no doubt, such wretchedness, never will we tolerate."
420007,Alvina,Talk-As A member of the Forest Hunters Covenant,"Ah, thou dost cometh. How fares ye? My hopes for thee are of the highest. Do not such a hope shatter with foul disproportion."
420008,Alvina,Talk-After vanquishing first Forest Invader as a Forest Hunters Member,"Ah yes, here is thine reward. It is for thee, take it! Make no attempt to show thineself as Hollow!"
420009,Alvina,Talk-After vanquishing 3 Forest Invader as a Forest Hunters Member,"Oh, thou art present! Shiva hath spoken of thee. I like that which I hear! I have heard murmuring about thee. I like that which I hear! I felt of thou indeed as a special one! The very moment mine eyes first set upon thee. Here's a precious reward. It is for thee, take it. May thine skill earn thee many more!"
420010,Alvina,Talk-After vanquishing 4 Forest Invader as a Forest Hunters Member,"Perchance... Hast thou met Shiva? A lad cometh from the far East, strong of arm; now a clan leader of ours. ...And yet... Still I feel that boy hides something. Of that I am certain. Small fear that he will use us badly... Yet on guard we must stay. And that man that clingeth to Shiva like some shadow... ensure thou dost treat him with the same caution."
420011,Alvina,After becoming hostile after betraying the Forest Hunters Covenant,"Oh, it is thee... Thine kinsmen are betrayed by thee. This doth bode most badly. No rest will ease thy rotten soul whilst there is one clansman living... Forever tormented thou shalt be by our very howls... Hellish villain, thou hast used us most foully, thine own family... For thee, no mercy shall be shown."
420012,Alvina,Upon being attacked,"Dee hee hee, dee hee hee! What a fool we have, what a wretched fool we have!"
430001,Anastacia,Talk,...
430002,Anastacia,Talk-After returning her Fire Keeper Soul,"...Th, thank you... ...I am Anastacia of Astora. ...Now I can continue my duty as a Keeper. ...But... ...I only hope that my impure tongue does not offend."
430003,Anastacia,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" After returning her Fire Keeper Soul","...Forgive me... ...I am impure, my tongue never intended for restoration. ...Please, if you have any heart... ...Leave me be... ...I wish not to speak..."
430004,Anastacia,Talk-After returning her Fire Keeper Soul & placing the Lordvessel for Frampt,"...That you have agreed to link the Fire. ...I thank you, sincerely. ...Finally, the curse of the Undead will be lifted, and I can die human. ...I am powerless, but I will do all that I can. ...Please, save us all... ...Please..."
440001,Andre,Talk-1st time,"Well, you must be a new arrival. I'm Andre, of Astora. If you require smithing, then speak to me."
440002,Andre,Talk-2nd time,"Well, hello again. You seem to be doing all right. Need anything forged?"
440003,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","Most weapons and armour are mighty sturdy indeed. But every hunk of metal has its breaking point. If you notice durability running low, it's time to repair. You can ask a blacksmith like meself, or do it on your own with a grindstone. The nice thing about weapons... they never betray you. So, pay them a little respect, eh?"
440004,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","There are two types of weapon forging. There's reinforcement, and there's ascension. Reinforcement is simple. It strengthens the weapon and nothing more. A simple task for any blacksmith. Hell, you could even do it yourself with a smithbox. But ascension's a finer art. It alters a weapon's properties. Ascension is the territory of we blacksmiths; a smithbox just won't do the trick. Start out with reinforcement. When that loses its charm, you can consider ascension. As you've noticed, this land is flush with the mad and wicked. You won't make it through the night without employing my services! Hah hah hah!"
440005,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","You can forge armour just like you do weapons. Forging armour is even easier than forging weapons. Whether you forge weapons or armour first? Well, that's up to you. But nobody wants to see you go Hollow. So, whatever you do, you'd better do it well! Hah hah hah!"
440006,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4rd time, after resting at a Bonfire","This is the old church. It was abandoned in favour of the church that you passed through. There are paths leading from here to two forbidden planes: Sen's Fortress, and the Darkroot Garden. They attract all sorts of lunatics, no-one as cultured as yourself. It's fine to be Undead, but keep a level head, eh? Hah hah hah!"
440007,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 5rd time, after resting at a Bonfire","Sen's Fortress is an old proving grounds built by the ancient gods. It is the only route leading to the great Anor Londo. Of course, most fools can't even find their way into that fortified deathtrap. But they won't stop trying! Take that bumbling Sir Onion... Hah hah hah!"
440008,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 6rd time, after resting at a Bonfire",I know little of the Darkroot Garden. Although I've heard rumours of a divine blacksmith who resides there. Those who get stumped in the Catacombs seek him for divine weapons.
440009,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 6rd time, after opening the floodgates in New Londo","Oh, yes, and one other thing about the Darkroot Garden. It is said to house the grave of Sir Artorias the Abysswalker. Only, of those who ventured into the forest, none has returned."
440010,Andre,Talk-After obtaining the Large Ember,"Ahh, why, that's a fine ember you have there. I could smith some mighty weapons with one of those. Why not lend it to me?"
440011,Andre,"Choose ""No"" to giving the Large Ember",I see...'Tis a pity...
440012,Andre,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Large Ember",Magnificent! You won't be disappointed. I can hardly wait to get started...
440013,Andre,Talk-After obtaining the Very Large Ember,"Well, I'll be! That's a brilliant ember you've got there! For all my years in the trade, that might be the finest! How's about...you leave that ember with me? I'm just an old smith. I'd give my left arm for a gem like that!"
440014,Andre,"Choose ""No"" to giving the Very Large Ember","I see...'Tis a pity... But perhaps you'd... No, no, it's quite all right... Quite all right, indeed..."
440015,Andre,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Very Large Ember","Well! Thank you mightily for that. Now, just leave the rest to me. Andre of Astora gets the job done, you shall see!"
440016,Andre,Talk-After obtaining the Divine Ember,"My, that's a rare ember you have there. I've seen one of those before... It's the ember of a divine blacksmith. Might you consider leaving that with me? I could produce divine weapons with a flame such as that."
440017,Andre,"Choose ""No"" to giving the Divine Ember",I see...'Tis a pity...
440018,Andre,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Divine Ember","Well, thanks for that! You've made a fine decision. You soon shall see!"
440019,Andre,Talk-After obtaining the Large Divine Ember,"Oh, my, what a brilliant ember you have there. I've only heard legends of such specimens... The embers used for the secret rites of divine blacksmiths... Perhaps you could lend it to me? I've long dreamed of forging divine weapons..."
440020,Andre,"Choose ""No"" to giving the Large Divine Ember",I see...'Tis a pity... I can't expect you to give up what's yours.
440021,Andre,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Large Divine Ember","Ah-hah! Splendid, splendid! Thank you! Andre of Astora never disappoints, I assure you!"
440022,Andre,Talk-After obtaining the Dark Ember,"Hrm? Show me that ember of yours... Well, I've never heard of a black ember. Hmmm... How about leaving that ember with me? I find it strangely fascinating.."
440023,Andre,"Choose ""No"" to giving the Dark Ember","Are you sure? Well, fair enough. Tis a pity, but I'll live."
440024,Andre,"Choose ""Yes"" to giving the Dark Ember","Yes, well! Thank you. This ember really is something special. I'm already under its spell. I sense great potential, indeed..."
440025,Andre,Talk-While holding an ember he cannot use,"Hmm, that's an odd ember you have there. Ahh, I know what you're thinking. But I'm no good with those. It won't be easy, but... I'm afraid you'll have to look for someone else."
440026,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" after purchasing something",Don't get yourself killed. Neither of us want to see you go Hollow.
440027,Andre,"Menu-Choose ""Leave"" without purchasing something","I'll be seeing you, then. Be careful out there."
440028,Andre,After leaving abruptly,"Oi, where're you off to?"
440029,Andre,Talk-After leaving abruptly,"What's going on with you, eh? I thought you'd gone Hollow there. Hah hah hah!"
440030,Andre,Upon being attacked-1st time,Ow!
440031,Andre,Upon being attacked-2nd time,"Owww, that hurts!"
440032,Andre,Upon being attacked & made hostile,"Well, you've got some nerve! Coming at me like that! I'll tear you to shreds! You bloody Hollow!"
440033,Andre,Upon dying,"Curses, you damn backstabber..."
